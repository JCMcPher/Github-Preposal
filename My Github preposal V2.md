# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

## My two biggest ideas are to make a drone thats follows you without you actually controlling it. Or a high speed first person shooter such as Titanfall2 aka(The best first person shooter ever made.)

TODO

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## I do not plan to collaborate with any classmates

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?

## My biggest concern is when does getting assistance become cheating. During this class I have hardly used any any internet source or outside assitance like a friend or youtube video because I thought that it would be cheating.  However when it come to a project of this caliber it goes without saying extreme assitance is needed. I don't want to do a project struggle at some point then look to see if somebody else had the same problem as me and just do their solution. It feels wrong and I fear that I would also get in trouble for it.


#  Please ignore the things above if you are reading this it means that my project has been switched. I settled on the drone project and 1 week in my drone was destroyed by a football. Becasue of this my project is now a perpetual calendar. It will be done in the C programming language.The reason for this is because this is the same project from another one of my classes. I have recieved the okay with my teacher I just need the email confirmation It will beasically take any date you want then will date you the day of the week along with the actual date. Lastly it will give you the option to create a file that holds a list of events for certain dates.
