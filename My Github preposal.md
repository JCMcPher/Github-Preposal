# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

## My two biggest ideas are to make a drone thats follows you without you actually controlling it. Or a high speed first person shooter such as Titanfall2 aka(The best first person shooter ever made.)

TODO

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## I do not plan to collaborate with any classmates

## Do you have any questions of your own?

## My biggest concern is when does getting assistance become cheating. During this class I have hardly used any any internet source or outside assitance like a friend or youtube video because I thought that it would be cheating.  However when it come to a project of this caliber it goes without saying extreme assitance is needed. I don't want to do a project struggle at some point then look to see if somebody else had the same problem as me and just do their solution. It feels wrong and I fear that I would also get in trouble for it.
